        Thank you for booking with Aleksandria Apartmens Vlorë. We understand that sometimes plans change, and flexibility is important. The following refund policy applies to all bookings made through our website, over the phone, or in person.
        
        Refund Eligibility
        To be eligible for a refund, you must cancel your booking at least five (5) days before your scheduled arrival date. Cancellations made after this period will not be eligible for a refund.
        
        How to Cancel Your Booking
        To cancel your booking, please contact us at our website with your booking reference number and the name the booking was made under. We will process your cancellation request and notify you of the outcome.
        
        Processing Refunds
        If you cancel your booking within the required timeframe (at least seven days before arrival):
        
        A full refund of any deposit or payment made will be processed.
        Refunds will be issued to the original method of payment within [insert number of days, typically 7-14 business days] from the cancellation confirmation.
        Please note that any service charges or processing fees applied at the time of booking may not be refundable.
        Late or Missing Refunds
        If you haven’t received a refund yet, first check your bank account again. Then contact your credit card company; it may take some time before your refund is officially posted. Next, contact your bank. There is often some processing time before a refund is posted. If you’ve done all of this and you still have not received your refund yet, please contact us at our website.
        
        Non-refundable Circumstances
        Please note that if you fail to cancel your booking at least seven days before your scheduled arrival or do not show up for your booking, you will not be eligible for a refund. Exceptions to this policy will only be considered under extenuating circumstances and at the discretion of Aleksandria Apartmens Vlorë management.
